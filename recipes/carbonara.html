    <img src="./images/website-carbinara.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>MOB's take on a classic. Absolutely no cream anywhere near this dish. Pepper, smoked bacon, egg yolk, parmesan &
        pasta water. Stuff dreams are made of.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Egg yolks</li>
        <li>300g Streaky Smoked Bacon</li>
        <li>75g Pecorino</li>
        <li>75g Parmesan</li>
        <li>500g Spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take a bowl, and grate in your Parmesan + Pecorino (set a pinch aside for sprinkling at the end).</li>
        <li>Then add 6 egg yolks, and a very, very generous amount of black pepper, 4 or 5 pinches of it. A good
            carbonara is meant to be peppery - hence the name, CARBONara. Whisk everything together and set aside.</li>
        <li>Chop your smoked bacon into little bits, and add to a frying pan.</li>
        <li>As they begin to brown, add your spaghetti to a pan of boiling water. Salt the boiling water - pasta water
            is meant to be almost as salty as the sea!</li>
        <li>Once the bacon is crisp, add 2 cloves of sliced garlic. Allow these to soften - if the garlic or bacon looks
            like it is catching on a pan, add small spoons of the starchy pasta water.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is 1 minute before being ready - so still quite al dente, take out 5 or 6 ladles of the pasta
            water and pour it into a bowl. Set this bowl aside.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, and then pour the pasta into the pan with the bacon and the garlic. Add a couple ladles of
            the pasta water, and cook everything together over a medium heat. Once the water has evaporated and the
            pasta is nice and silky, take off the heat.</li>
        <li>Allow to cool down for 1 minute, and then add the egg and parmesan mixture, and another ladle of the water
            and mix it all together.</li>
        <li>If it looks too thick, add a bit more water. It should be silky smooth! Serve with a sprinkle of parmesan
            and twist or two more of black pepper! Enjoy!</li>

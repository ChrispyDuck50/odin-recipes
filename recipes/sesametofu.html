    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Crispy tofu in a gingery, sticky sauce. One of the all time great tofu dishes for the MOB.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>560g Tofu (we use Tofoo)</li>
        <li>Knob of Ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>50g Cornflour</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>3 Spring Onions</li>
        <li>400g Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>1 Red Chilli</li>
        <li>1 Clove of Garlic</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop your tofu up into little cubes. Dab cubes with kitchen roll to remove the excess moisture. Place the
            tofu cubes into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add 4 tbsp of your soy sauce, one heaped tbsp of grated ginger, a tsp of grated garlic, and sesame oil.
            Gently mix together.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl, place it in the fridge and leave to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove tofu from the fridge. Pour a good helping of cornflour into a bowl. One by one, roll each tofu cube
            in the cornflour so they are coated on all sides. By the end, they should all have a gummy layer of
            cornflour on each side.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 part rice to 2 parts boiling water into a pan and cook on a medium heat, until the rice has absorbed
            all the water.</li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan and pour in a good glug of vegetable oil. Place your tofu cubes in the pan. Cook on
            a medium heat. Each cube will need about 4 minutes on each side. Just keep turning them until all sides are
            golden.</li>
        <li>Once golden on all sides, remove the cubes from the heat. Set them on some kitchen roll so any excess oil is
            soaked up.</li>
        <li>Sauce time. Place a pan on the heat and pour in the leftover marinade. Add your last tbsp of soy sauce, a
            chopped red chilli, chopped spring onions, a tsp of grated ginger and a glass of water.</li>
        <li>As the sauce is bubbling, mix one tsp of cornflour in with a glass of water until it is dissolved. Pour this
            water into the sauce and mix it in. Remove the sauce from the heat when it is thick and sticky.</li>
        <li>Time to serve up. In a bowl, spoon in some rice, then lots of the crispy tofu and pour over some of the
            sauce. Garnish with some chopped spring onions and tuck in! Enjoy!</li>

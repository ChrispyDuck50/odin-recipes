    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We have perfected the aglio e olio. Lemon is key. Creating an emulsion with the olive oil & the pasta water makes
        the most delicious pasta you'll ever eat.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bunch of Parsley (100g)</li>
        <li>500g Spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Chilli Flakes</li>
        <li>8 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp Good Quality Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a pan of water, salt it generously and then add your spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Get a frying pan and heat 6 tbsps of olive oil. Finely slice your garlic and add to the pan with your chilli
            flakes. It is important to not let your garlic burn so keep stirring it on a low heat.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is al dente, reserve 7-8 tbsps of the starchy pasta water and add it into the garlic pan
            along with a pinch of salt. Stir together and lightly simmer. This is when the sauce will start coming
            together.</li>
        <li>Chop your parsley (saving some for garnish) and drain the pasta. Add them both into the frying pan along
            with the juice from a lemon. Salt the dish and start tossing it all together to create an emulsion between
            the pasta water and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Once everything is mixed in and the pasta is thick and almost creamy (from the pasta water), remove from the
            heat. Season and serve it up with extra chopped parsley on top as a garnish. Drizzle over some more olive
            oil. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
